# DNA Sequencing

To put DNA strands in the right order, two incomplete DNA strands are compared to see if they match when overlapped. IF so, they could be part of a bigger strand or a genome.

This program finds the best match between a target DNA strand and several candidate DNA strands. The program takes a target DNA strand from one file, and the candidate DNA strand from a second file. 

Target files are marked tarX.txt, candidate files are marked canX.txt, and after inputing those two files they can be compared to the solX.txt file. For example, input tar0.txt and can0.txt and compare the results to sol0.txt.
