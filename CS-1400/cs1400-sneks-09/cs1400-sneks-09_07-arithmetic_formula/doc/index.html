<p>Because computers are very good at doing math, we won&#39;t have to worry about
doing much math in this course. In fact, learning how to program is actually
more similar to learning a new language! Regardless, it&#39;s good to remember how
to do a little math. For this exercise, you will print out the result of one
more calculation. This time convert the temperature 50Â° Fahrenheit to Celsius
using the following conversion formula:</p>

<p><code>celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9</code></p>

<p>Remember, you should not embed the result directly into your code. You must
print out the result of this calculation.</p>
