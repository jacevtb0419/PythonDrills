# 39.5) Mapping Classes

Create a dictionary to use as a lookup table that maps your courses (represented
by the department code and course number, like "CS1400") to the percentage of
your course-related time that they consume. For example, the key "CS1400" might
map to .25 or any other float value. The values of the dictionary should add up
to 1.0 to represent all of the time you spend on your coursework. After defining
such a dictionary, use the dictionary lookup syntax to print the value
associated with the key "CS1400".

You will not be graded (or judged) based on the amount of time you dedicate to
this class :)
