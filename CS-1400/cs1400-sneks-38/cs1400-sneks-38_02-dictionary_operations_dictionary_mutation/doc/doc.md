# 38.2) Dictionary Mutation

Needing to edit dictionaries is not very common, but sometimes it is useful.
Write a function named `make_older` that consumes a dictionary (representing a
person) and increases its "Age" key's value by 1. The function should return the
new age. Call the function on the two given person dictionaries to advance their
ages, being sure to unit test the function AND to assert that both dictionaries
have changed their value.

Note: This function modifies the dictionary that it consumes. Like lists,
dictionaries are mutable.
