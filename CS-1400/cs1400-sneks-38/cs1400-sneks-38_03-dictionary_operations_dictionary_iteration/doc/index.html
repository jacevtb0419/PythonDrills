<p>The dictionary below maps book titles to their prices. Using a <code>for</code> loop, print
out each book title and its price, each on their own line, separated by a single
space. Recall that the print function can take more than one argument.</p>

<p>Note: do not use the <code>.items()</code> method for this problem.</p>
