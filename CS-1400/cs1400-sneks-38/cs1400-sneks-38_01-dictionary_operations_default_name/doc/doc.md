# 38.1) Default Name

Create a function named `get_default_name` that, given a dictionary, returns the
value associated with the key "Dog's Name" However, if the key "Dog's Name" is
missing, it should return the string "No dog". Try running this function on a
dictionary representing your favorite dog (or, if you don't like dogs, use an
empty dictionary). You should unit test your function.
