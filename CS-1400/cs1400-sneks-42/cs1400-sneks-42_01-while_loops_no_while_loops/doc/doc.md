# 42.1) No While Loops

Replace the `while` statement in the given program with a `for` statement by
using the built-in function `range`, which consumes a number and returns a list
up to that number. For example, `range(5)` evaluates to the list `[0,1,2,3,4]`.

In the end, the program should print out the sum of the numbers from 0 up to
(but not including) 100.
