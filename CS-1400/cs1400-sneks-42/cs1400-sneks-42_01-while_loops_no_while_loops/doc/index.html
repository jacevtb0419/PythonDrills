<p>Replace the <code>while</code> statement in the given program with a <code>for</code> statement by
using the built-in function <code>range</code>, which consumes a number and returns a list
up to that number. For example, <code>range(5)</code> evaluates to the list <code>[0,1,2,3,4]</code>.</p>

<p>In the end, the program should print out the sum of the numbers from 0 up to
(but not including) 100.</p>
