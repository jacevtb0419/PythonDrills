<p>Use a <code>while</code> loop to repeatedly take <code>input</code> from the user and print whatever
they type in. When the user enters the empty string (<code>&#34;&#34;</code>), then your program
should stop. For simplicity, you should print the empty string typed by the user
at the end.</p>

<p>Be very careful that you don&#39;t end up with an infinite loop!</p>
