# 42.2) While Input

Use a `while` loop to repeatedly take `input` from the user and print whatever
they type in. When the user enters the empty string (`""`), then your program
should stop. For simplicity, you should print the empty string typed by the user
at the end.

Be very careful that you don't end up with an infinite loop!
