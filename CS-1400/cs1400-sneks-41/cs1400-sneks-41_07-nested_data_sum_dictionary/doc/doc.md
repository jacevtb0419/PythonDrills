# 41.7) Sum Dictionary

The given function `sum_dictionary` is meant to consume a
dictionary of lists and return a dictionary of numbers representing the sum of
the elements in each list.

For example, when the function is called in the given program, the dictionary
`{"Module 1": 23, "Module 2": 22, "Module 3": 31}` should be returned. However,
the function definition has had all of its code moved to before its definition.

Rearrange the lines of code before the definition to be inside the definition,
and correct their indentation. Do not add, remove, or change any of those
lines. You may get a few indentation or syntax errors along the way. Think about
how the statements should be arranged and look for clues that suggest
indentation (e.g., what does a colon mean?).
