<p>The given function <code>sum_dictionary</code> is meant to consume a
dictionary of lists and return a dictionary of numbers representing the sum of
the elements in each list.</p>

<p>For example, when the function is called in the given program, the dictionary
<code>{&#34;Module 1&#34;: 23, &#34;Module 2&#34;: 22, &#34;Module 3&#34;: 31}</code> should be returned. However,
the function definition has had all of its code moved to before its definition.</p>

<p>Rearrange the lines of code before the definition to be inside the definition,
and correct their indentation. Do not add, remove, or change any of those
lines. You may get a few indentation or syntax errors along the way. Think about
how the statements should be arranged and look for clues that suggest
indentation (e.g., what does a colon mean?).</p>
