<p>Write a function <code>extract_key</code> that consumes a list of dictionaries and a key (a
string). It should return a list of just the values of each dictionary in the
list that is associated with the key.</p>

<p>For example, calling the function with the animals dictionary and the key
&#34;Height&#34; should return the the list [18, 16, 2]. See the unit test in the given
program. Note that your function should be generalized to work for any list of
dictionaries, not just a list of animals like the one in the given program.</p>
