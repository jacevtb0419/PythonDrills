# 41.8) Extract Key

Write a function `extract_key` that consumes a list of dictionaries and a key (a
string). It should return a list of just the values of each dictionary in the
list that is associated with the key.

For example, calling the function with the animals dictionary and the key
"Height" should return the the list [18, 16, 2]. See the unit test in the given
program. Note that your function should be generalized to work for any list of
dictionaries, not just a list of animals like the one in the given program.
