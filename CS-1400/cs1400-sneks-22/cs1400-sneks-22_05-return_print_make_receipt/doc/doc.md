# 22.5) Making a Receipt

Write a function `make_receipt` that consumes a float representing the price of
a meal. The function needs to do the following:

- Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the price by `.9` (a 10% discount)
- Print out the original price passed in.
- Print out the discounted price.
- Return the discounted price

Now, consider the scenario where you just bought a meal for $20, but the manager
was so impressed with your programming ability that they decided to discount it
twice. Call this function on the original $20 meal price, then call it again on
the discounted price (think expressions!). Do not unit test this function.

Read over all of the instructions carefully and consider the effects of printing
and returning. If you are struggling, here's one last hint: variables are your
friend!
