<p>Write a function <code>begins_with_vowel</code> that consumes a non-empty string and
returns whether the first character of that string is a vowel. A simple way to
test if a single character is a vowel is to determine if it is in the string
<code>&#34;AEIOU&#34;</code>. Keep in mind that your function should work for both
uppercase and lowercase letters. Unit test the function to ensure that it
works.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not use any <code>if</code> statements in solving this. That may seem
impossible, but remember how you can return a boolean by returning the result of
a boolean expression.</p>
