# 21.5) A Vowel Function

Write a function `begins_with_vowel` that consumes a non-empty string and
returns whether the first character of that string is a vowel. A simple way to
test if a single character is a vowel is to determine if it is in the string
`"AEIOU"`. Keep in mind that your function should work for both
uppercase and lowercase letters. Unit test the function to ensure that it
works.

**Note:** Do not use any `if` statements in solving this. That may seem
impossible, but remember how you can return a boolean by returning the result of
a boolean expression.
