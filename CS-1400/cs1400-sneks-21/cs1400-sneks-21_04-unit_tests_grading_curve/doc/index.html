<p>The formula below calculates a curved grade by applying a square root according
to the following formula:</p>

<p><code>original_grade^.5 * 10</code></p>

<p>Define a function named <code>curve_grade</code> that consumes a grade and uses the formula
to return the curved grade. Write at least three unit tests for the function to
confirm that it works.</p>

<p>Note: the formula above is not correct Python syntax. What is the proper Python
operator for the exponent operation?</p>
